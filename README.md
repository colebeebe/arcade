# Overview

The purpose of this project was to learn more about game development. This project was written in two weeks, and is an implementation of the arcade games Asteroids and Lunar Lander.

This was written in the Godot engine, version 4.5.1. To run the software, the .exe and .pck files can be downloaded. They must be placed in the same folder. The exe can then be run as normal. You may get a warning saying that Windows protected your PC. Clicking 'more info' and then 'Run Anyway' will allow you to run it. This is because you've just downloaded an .exe from the internet, which could be dangerous. If this makes you nervous, all the project files are public, and if you'd like to build it yourself, you can download Godot 4.5.1 (I can't speak to any future or past updates). From there, opening the project, you can click the play button in the top-right corner or if you want to export an executable that can be done as well.

# Development Environment

The only thing I used for this project was the Godot editor itself. The language used was the scripting language, GDScript. No external libraries were used in this project.

# Future Work

* I originally wanted to add a third game. I was looking at Breakout, so it could be fun to implement it in the future.
* The original intent was to have a much more interactive and aesthetically pleasing main menu, but due to time constraints, this had to be cut. I'd like to add it in the future.
* I would like to add a saving high score system
